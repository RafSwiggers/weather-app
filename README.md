# Weather App!

## Intro and Summary
 Alright ladies and gentlemen, time to get excited! Today we're making an app that you'll actually find in the wild. It will involve getting information from a different service, displaying it in an attractive layout and getting user input. Not in that order.

 ## Objective
The goal is to make a webpage that lets the user input a city. The webpage then displays the weather for that city for the next five days.

## Why?
This is an introduction into API's, getting and using information from different services than our own information and programs.
